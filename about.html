    <p> As of August 2020, I have been a Ph.D. student studying Criminology for three years. I am now studying for comps, thinking about a dissertation topic, and editing publications.</p>




    <h2>What I am Doing:</h2>

    	<h3><b>(1)</b> I am currently working on publishing two papers. One deals with an algorithm for hot spots policing. The second deals with evaluating the effects of gentrification on juvenile homicide.</h3>
  		<h3><b>(2)</b> I continously write a blog on <a href="https://www.notion.so/tiredcrimstudent/Getting-Started-747efca38af348568fc699ce61d8442e">criminological theories</a>. I mainly write for a undergraduate audience. However, it also serves the purpose of helping me explain theories better and learn about their histories!</h3>
  		<h3><b>(3)</b> Inbetween writing and studying, I teach myself and get more comfortable with python and sql. I make random side projects to help keep my skills intact.</h3>
		

    <h2>Other Stuff:</h2>
    	
    	<h3> <b>(1)</b> I dive deep into reading about historical places and buildings! Ask me about fun facts about gentrification or buildings and we can chat!</h3>
  		<h3> <b>(2)</b> I enjoy taking long motorcycle trips cross-country. This helps clear my mind and manage burnout!</h3>
  		<h3> <b>(3)</b> With COVID-19 making everything online, I try to keep all lectures recorded and online for free use! (Hopefully to come soon).</h3>
