       			 We introduce a new method for identifying patrol routes in hot spots through ridge estimation. Our goal is to explore the application of density ridges to hot spots and patrol optimization. Earlier applications of patrol optimization create routes covering the entire jurisdiction. We refine patrol optimization to only focus on the critical areas in hot spots. We extract density ridges of 2018 to early 2019 Part I crime incidents from Chicago to demonstrate nonlinear mode-following ridges in agreement with broader kernel density estimates. We create multi-run confidence intervals and show that our patrol templates cover around 94% of incidents for 0.1-mile envelopes around ridges. We show that ridges following crime densities enhances the efficiency of patrols. Our post-hoc tests show the stability of ridges, thus offering an alternative patrol route option that is effective and efficient. We suggest further research into the application and efficacy of density ridges for patrolling.

      			Labeling theory emphasizes the notion that crime is a social construction. Primarily, what makes a criminal act, criminal, and what defines a person as acriminal varies across individuals and contexts. Labeling theory, thus, focuses on what combination of factors and circumstances shape individuals who are labeled as deviants. Additionally, theorists analyze the reactions of the government and community surrounding the individual. How does each individual or community influence the recipient of a label’s decisions, if at all? Research has yet to understand all the factors that comprise labeling theory. Therefore, labeling theory can provide an important reminder that a person’s criminality is not a single dimension. Instead, multiple aspects such as the criminal justice system, family and friends, work together in a process to influence the behavior of a person.

      			Research consistently suggests that law enforcement officers are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety, acute and posttraumatic stress, and depression than individuals in other professions. In turn, these psychological factors have been found to have serious effects on the mental well-being, physical health, and life span of officers. In recent years, several steps have been taken to “end the silence” surrounding the mental health and wellness of law enforcement officers. In 2015, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing highlighted officer safety and wellness as one of the six pillars for policing. In its final report, the task force recommended the promotion of officer wellness at all levels of law enforcement. More recently, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, passed into U.S. law in 2018, has supported the expansion of wellness services across federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. </p>

				At the organizational level, law enforcement agencies implement a broad continuum of officer mental health and wellness policies and programs. These efforts range from providing officers access to information on mental health resources to the use of annual mental health wellness checks, in-service training, peer support initiatives, and psychological services. While this emphasis on officer wellness across the field of policing is encouraging, it is essential to consider whether these efforts are based upon research and evidence about “what works” in enhancing officer mental health outcomes. Similar to other areas in policing, the design and implementation of policies and programs for officer wellness should be based on evidence.	</p>

      				The purpose of this interpretive case study was to explore the perceptions and attitudes of at-riskyouth subsequent to their participation in an experiential learning wilderness program. Thirty-three male participants aged 11-14 participated in the study. Findings are based on a thematic analysis of qualitative data gathered through semi-structured interviews within the framework of resiliency theory. Results indicate favorable perceptions and attitudes for activities within the program and for the themes of communication, conflict resolution, and community engagement, and a sense of resiliency against challenges. These constructs are described in the Youth Risk Program Evaluation Tool (YARPET) and the literature review as typically targeted youth development objectives for adventure-based youth-at-risk programs. Theoretical and practical implications for experiential programming include concepts of resiliency, risk, and protective factors.</p>
